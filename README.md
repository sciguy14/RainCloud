The *RainCloud* Umbrella Minder
=============================
The *RainCloud* is a web-connected smart umbrella holder. Built around the [LittleBits](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=966033&b=601008&m=53280&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Elittlebits%2Ecc) [Cloud Bit](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=966033&b=601008&m=53280&afftrack=&urllink=littlebits%2Ecc%2Fcloud), the *RainCloud* allows you to tell with a glance if you need to bring your umbrella with you for the day! A 3D-printed stand holds the umbrella, and features a subtle EL-wire pattern that illuminates if rain is imminent. If you're very forgetful, the *RainCloud* will even ping your phone to inform you that you've left you umbrella behind if you leave home without it on a potentially rainy day.

Parts and Instructions
======================
A list of all needed parts, as well as detailed instructions on how to build the *RainCloud* is available on my website: <http://www.jeremyblum.com/2014/07/22/raincloud/>

To Do...
========
* I should probably setup log rotation for the listening service, and clean up the format of the log entries
* I'd like to add integration with [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/), for when you forget your umbrella
